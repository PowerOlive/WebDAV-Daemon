# Author Philip Couling
# This file is used by the package-project script in the 
# DpkgBuildTools project to build a build a dpkg package from this project
#
# This quite simply lists which files from this project to put where on the target system.
# Blank lines and lines starting with a '#' are ignored as white space and comments.
# The special folder DEBIAN is used by dpkg-deb automatically to control the project.
#
# Instructional lines are formed of four sections separated by colons ':'.
#
# action:source:target:file-mode
# - action 
#   currently supports "file", "dir", "link", control and source
#       file adds a file from the project to the target system (dirs are created automatically).
#            this can also be used to place entire directories
#       dir creates an empty dir and or changes it's mode. This is useful when the parent dir
#            should have specific permissions which are different to its children.
#       link creates a symbolic link on the target system.
#            source is relative to the target link
#       control copies a control file to DEBIAN/control. If SVN is installed and the current source 
#            file is in a working copy, the revision number will be appended to the version number. 
#            Also the size will be replaced by the actual size at the end of packaging. 
#       source changes the current source directory from this point forward in the file.
#            This is very helpful when the manifest exists in a subdirectory of the project.
#            The path is always relative to the manifest file.
#
# - source 
#       link: must be a file relative to a file on the target system, this may be 
#           a file provided by the project or one expected to exist already on the target system
#       file: must be a file provided by the project being packaged
#       dir: file is ignored.
#       control: the control file to copy
#       source: the new source directory
#
# - target: must be a be a location RELATIVE to the root of the target system.
#       this is ignored for control and source actions 
#
# - file-mode: sets the file mode for the files being copied and any directories in the process.
#       execute permissions are automatically given to directories.
#       this is ignored for control and source actions
